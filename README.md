# _Mini Munchies_ - Restaurant Page

This is a webpage for a mock restaurant that was created as practice for using ES6 modules and getting used to writing modular code. This is also the first time using `npm` and a `package.json` file to track dependencies. Also the first time using Webpack to bundle.
